capture current age
capture retirement age

retirement - age = t

capture principal = (savings + investments + social security)

capture interest rate on savings account
capture how often it compounds (monthly = 12, annually = 1)
capture gender (get life expectancy for male/female)
capture monthly expenses

money needed = ((expectancy - retirement) * 12) * monthly expenses

let amount = (Principal * (1 + (interest rate / number of times it compounds)));
amount = Math.pow(amount, number of times it compounts)
amount = Math.pow(amount, (retirement - age));

if(amount >= money needed){
you're golden
}
